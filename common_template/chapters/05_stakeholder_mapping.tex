\chapter{Understanding Stakeholder Voices}
\label{ch:stakeholder-mapping}

Successful Agile implementation depends on engaging stakeholders effectively. Studies show that stakeholder relationships strongly influence satisfaction and delivery outcomes \textit{\parencite{verwijs2021scrum}}. Djøf Trade Union learned to identify stakeholders and build collaborative relationships that support value delivery.

\section{Stakeholder Identification and Collaboration}
\label{sec:identifying-stakeholders}

The organization serves two groups: internal employees and union members \textbf{(Transcript: 00:01:34)}. Internal employees use systems for booking management and account administration. Union members interact with member facing systems. These groups create challenges because their needs do not always align.

The Product Owner bridges stakeholder groups and the development team. Before Scrum, tasks arrived chaotically without clear understanding of who needed work or why. Now the Product Owner gathers needs from both groups, translates them into backlog items, and ensures the team understands context \textbf{(Transcript: 00:11:22)}.

Stakeholders have different influence and interest levels. Leadership cares about member growth and operational efficiency. They set budget priorities and decide which initiatives receive funding. Daily system users provide practical feedback about what works and what frustrates them.

Refinement lets stakeholders shape solutions before development begins. The team breaks down epics collaboratively with input from users \textbf{(Transcript: 00:05:30)}. When stakeholders participate in defining acceptance criteria, they gain realistic expectations.

Sprint reviews became regular touchpoints where stakeholders see completed work and provide feedback \textbf{(Transcript: 00:20:37)}. Quarterly demos showcase three months of progress to broader audiences, expanding transparency.

When users approach Ahmed directly with ideas, he listens but redirects them to the Product Owner for prioritization \textbf{(Transcript: 00:29:22)}. This protects the team while recognizing valuable ideas.

\section{Managing Competing Interests and Communication}
\label{sec:competing-interests}

Stakeholders do not always agree. Economic constraints take priority: when leadership determines something costs too much, the project stops regardless of user enthusiasm \textbf{(Transcript: 00:36:17)}. Technical feasibility also matters. When requests would compromise system integrity, developers push back with Product Owner support.

The team learned to find middle ground. Understanding underlying needs often reveals alternative solutions. Successful Agile transformations require balancing multiple influences, with developer skills and management support being critical factors \textit{\parencite{russo2021agile}}.

Stakeholder management improved significantly with Agile practices. Structured refinement, regular reviews, transparent backlog, and clear Product Owner ownership created predictability that reduces frustration. Stakeholders know when to expect features. Management sees progress through transparent metrics rather than status reports.

The team established multiple feedback channels tailored to different groups. Members receive newsletters announcing new features. Internal stakeholders participate in sprint reviews and observe the Jira backlog. Leadership receives quarterly progress updates aligned with strategic objectives. These layered approaches ensure appropriate information without overwhelming the team.
