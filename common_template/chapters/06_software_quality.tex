\chapter{Maintaining Software Quality}
\label{ch:software-quality}

Quality became a shared responsibility as Djøf Trade Union adopted Agile practices. Rather than relying on end-of-cycle testing, they built quality checks into every development step. Tests run automatically, code reviews happen before merge, and features deploy to multiple environments.

\section{Automated Testing and Code Reviews}
\label{sec:automated-testing}

Djøf Trade Union uses Azure DevOps pipelines to catch problems early. When developers finish a feature, they push code to a branch \textbf{(Transcript: 00:12:52--00:13:22)}. The pipeline runs unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests immediately. Failed tests notify developers right away.

Code reviews add another quality layer. A colleague must review every pull request before merge \textbf{(Transcript: 00:13:22)}. Their Definition of Done makes quality concrete: code reviewed, tests passing, deployed to staging, and validated \textbf{(Transcript: 00:18:37)}.

Bugs still appear. When they do, they fix them immediately without estimation. If too many bugs arrive in one sprint, they reduce feature commitments for the next sprint.

\section{Legacy Systems and Feedback Integration}
\label{sec:legacy-feedback}

Legacy code presents ongoing challenges. Some systems lack documentation, making changes difficult \textbf{(Transcript: 00:16:07)}. The team isolates new code from legacy systems where possible.

The pipeline improved over time. Manual deployments evolved into automated stages. Developers deploy to dev, then test, then production \textbf{(Transcript: 00:13:22)}. Each environment catches different problems.

Azure DevOps manages the build pipeline and testing automation. Teams handles daily communication, and Jira tracks work items \textbf{(Transcript: 00:19:22)}.

Sprint reviews and quarterly demos provide quality feedback from stakeholders \textbf{(Transcript: 00:20:37--00:21:07)}. The Product Owner gathers member feedback through newsletters and brings it back to the team.

Quality improved through consistent practices. Automated tests, code reviews, multiple deployment stages, and regular feedback work together to catch problems before production.
