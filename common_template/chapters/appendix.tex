\label{app:interview-questions}

\textit{\small Note: The following questions were originally asked in Danish. English translations are provided below.}

\section{Welcome and Introduction}
\label{app:introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hello and thank you for taking the time to meet. My name is Jawad and I study software engineering at AAU Copenhagen. I am working on an exam where I need to interview an experienced developer about how work is conducted as a software developer, and we will spend some time on this. If it's okay with you, I will record the conversation so I can transcribe it afterwards. Is that okay?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Experiences - Success and Challenges}
\label{app:project-experiences}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First of all, I would like to talk a bit about project experiences. If you were to show a new team member an example of how things are done at your workplace, which project would you choose that you work with? And why that one specifically?
    \item Have you experienced having a project that did not live up to expectations? And if you were to return to that project together with your company, what would you have done differently? Have you had any bad experiences with the way work is conducted in your projects?
    \item That makes good sense. When you look back at all the projects and tasks you have been involved in, what characterizes those that just flow and have really good momentum? Are there any principles from Agile that you use, or some priorities, something that makes it easier and more pleasant to work with?
    \item Are there other things you measure - for example customer satisfaction? How do you assess whether your project was a success, not only for your goals within development, but also whether it is something that has delivered value in the real world?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Work Methods and Daily Practice}
\label{app:work-methods}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Now I would like to talk more about work methods and daily practice. How would you describe your approach to development? Is there a specific methodology you use, such as Scrum?
    \item How has it evolved over time? Have there been changes in the way you have worked within Scrum, or have you just kept it from the start?
    \item Are there things you have changed about your work method with Scrum over time?
    \item Can you tell me about the process that is gone through when you have received a task? What happens from when you receive the task until it reaches the users? Which steps must you go through for the task to be carried out in reality?
    \item How long are your sprints? Have you experimented with other lengths?
    \item Who decides what should be done first? How does that prioritization work?
    \item What is the best thing about your current way of working?
    \item And what is most frustrating in the daily work?
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Team and Collaboration}
\label{app:team-collaboration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can you paint a picture of the team for me - who is involved, and what are their roles?
    \item How do you ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction - that everyone knows what is important right now?
    \item How do you communicate on a daily basis - standups, Slack, ad hoc meetings?
    \item How much contact do you have with those who actually use the product?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Measurement and Continuous Improvement}
\label{app:measurement}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do you keep track of whether you are on the right path? Do you track velocity, lead time, or other metrics?
    \item Do you hold retrospectives? Can you give an example of something you have changed based on a retro?
    \item Do you feel that management supports your way of working? Do you have the freedom and resources you need?
    \item How good are you at changing direction when requirements change?
    \item How do you ensure that competencies in the team stay sharp?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Quality and Testing}
\label{app:quality-testing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When is a task 'done' for you - what needs to be in place before you say finished?
    \item What do you do to ensure quality along the way - code review, pair programming, static analysis?
    \item Can you describe your test approach - which types of tests do you run, and when?
    \item How much of your testing is automated? Do you trust that tests catch the problems?
    \item What happens when you find a bug - what is the process from when it is discovered until it is fixed?
\end{enumerate}

\section{AI in Development}
\label{app:ai-development}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have you adopted AI tools for development - Copilot, Claude, Cursor, or similar?
    \item What do you primarily use it for? Where does it provide the most value in everyday work?
    \item Has it noticeably changed how you work?
    \item Have you experienced situations where AI-generated code has created problems?
    \item Has management said anything about what you may and may not do with AI in the codebase?
    \item How do you see AI in the future for your workplace? Could you see it taking over more and perhaps reducing the number of employees, or will it still be the human element that delivers quality?
\end{enumerate}

\section{CI/CD and Technical Setup}
\label{app:cicd-setup}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can you describe the journey from when you push code until it runs in production - which steps does it pass through?
    \item Which tools do you use in your CI/CD setup - GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, or something else?
    \item How much runs automatically vs. how much requires manual approval?
    \item How often do you deploy to production? Is it continuous, daily, weekly, or after a specific sprint?
    \item What happens when something goes wrong in production - who gets the alarm, and what is the process?
    \item Where do you experience the biggest challenges in your pipeline?
    \item If you had free hands to improve one thing in your setup, what would it be?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Stakeholders and the Outside World}
\label{app:stakeholders}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who do you primarily make the product for? Who are your most important stakeholders?
    \item What happens when different stakeholders have opposing interests? Let's say members want something, but it conflicts with what the organization wants, or it is too costly. Who has the final say?
    \item How do you keep different groups updated on what is happening in the project?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Closing}
\label{app:closing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many years have you been doing software development?
    \item If you were to give advice to someone who has just started - what is important to focus on to have a good work environment and be able to function well and deliver something?
\end{enumerate}
