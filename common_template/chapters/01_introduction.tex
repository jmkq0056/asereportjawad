\label{ch:introduction}

This report analysis is part of the exam assignment in the Agile Software Engineering course at Aalborg University Copenhagen. The purpose is to analyze and evaluate the implementation of Agile principles in practice and understand what they mean for a project's success. To gain this insight, I chose to interview Ahmed Sadiq, a software developer with 10 to 12 years of experience at Djøf Trade Union. Ahmed works in their internal development department, building critical systems such as booking platforms, account management, and APIs for both internal employees and external union members \textbf{(Transcript: 00:01:05--00:01:34)}.

It's worth noting that the organization previously struggled with legacy systems and unclear processes, which led them to gradually adopt Scrum methodology. However, they haven't followed Scrum strictly. The team dropped story points because stakeholders found them confusing, and they occasionally skip retrospectives when a sprint lacks meaningful progress \textbf{(Transcript: 00:08:58--00:10:22)}. This pragmatic approach reflects broader industry trends where teams adapt Agile frameworks to their specific contexts rather than following them rigidly \textit{(State of Agile Report)}.

This report will examine how they implement Agile practices in their daily work, focusing on their refinement processes, quality assurance approaches, deployment pipeline, and stakeholder management. The analysis will use knowledge from the Agile Software Engineering course to understand how theoretical principles manifest in practice.
