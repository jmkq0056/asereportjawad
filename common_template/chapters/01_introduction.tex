As part of the Agile Software Engineering course at Aalborg University Copenhagen, I conducted an interview with Ahmed Sadiq to explore how Agile methods function in a real organization. Ahmed has over 10 years of experience as a developer at Djøf Trade Union, where he builds internal systems including booking platforms, account management tools, and APIs that serve both staff and union members.

Djøf's development team came to Scrum gradually, driven by frustrations with legacy systems and unclear workflows. They take a pragmatic stance: story points were dropped when stakeholders found them confusing, and retrospectives are skipped if a sprint offers little to reflect on. Such adaptations reflect a broader pattern in the industry, where teams shape Agile frameworks around their needs rather than applying them rigidly \textit{(State of Agile Report)}.

The analysis that follows covers refinement processes, quality assurance, deployment pipelines, and stakeholder dynamics, drawing on course theory to interpret what works at Djøf and why.
