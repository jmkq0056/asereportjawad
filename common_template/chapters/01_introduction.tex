This report is part of the exam assignment in the Agile Software Engineering course at Aalborg University Copenhagen. The aim is to analyze how Agile principles are implemented in practice and assess their impact on project success. For this purpose, I interviewed Ahmed Sadiq, a software developer with over 10 years of experience at Djøf Trade Union. Ahmed works in the internal development department, where he builds systems like booking platforms, account management tools, and APIs serving both employees and union members.

The organization faced challenges with legacy systems and unclear processes before gradually adopting Scrum. Their approach is not strictly by-the-book: the team stopped using story points after stakeholders found them confusing, and they sometimes skip retrospectives when a sprint has little to discuss. This adaptive approach aligns with industry trends where teams modify Agile frameworks to fit their context rather than following rigid prescriptions \textit{(State of Agile Report)}.

This report examines their Agile practices, covering refinement processes, quality assurance, deployment pipelines, and stakeholder management, using concepts from the course to connect theory with practice.
