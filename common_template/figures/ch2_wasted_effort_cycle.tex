\caption{Wasted effort cycle before Scrum adoption. Work requests arrived without refinement or feasibility checks, developers started tasks that seemed simple, hidden blockers emerged late in development, and work was abandoned after 2-4 weeks of effort. Without retrospectives or process changes, this pattern repeated continuously.}
